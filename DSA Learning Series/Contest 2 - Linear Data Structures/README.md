# Contest 2 - Linear Data Structures

## Details

* This contest is a part of [DSA Learning Series](https://www.codechef.com/LEARNDSA)
* __Topic of the Contest__ : Linear Data Structures - Vectors, Pairs, Linked List, Stacks, Queue
* __Pre-requisite of the contest__ : NONE

## Resources

Almost all problems in computer science require the usage of some form of linear data structure. These are fundamental in algorithms. Each of them has its own specific use cases and has tradeoffs (especially space and time tradeoffs with various operations).

All program languages have these data structures built into their library so you can use it without having to write it again every time.

Feel free to use any resources to learn these topics. Remember, Google is your best friend for learning anything. We have attached a few links that could help.
