# Contribution Rules


* Do not ask or discuss any aspect of any CodeChefs’ problem during an ongoing contest here or on any other platform, online or offline. Discussion of strategy should be avoided during the contest and postponed till the end.
* You should avoid sharing formulae, logic, or any other significant aspect of your code during an ongoing contest.
* If you are taking part in CodeChef’s contests, you must take good care of your code. Protect it from getting leaked, getting shared, and getting copied by your foes, friends, or just a random peer. It is your responsibility to provide it the safety it deserves.
* The code you will be contributing should only be shared after the contest ends (Except the training series).
* Taking help or using third party code is not bad. Passing it off as your own is. If you are taking your code from some other source, it is expected that you give the due attribution to the source in your code. It is mandatory.
